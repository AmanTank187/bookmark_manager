# bookmark_manager

As an angry cat\
So i can order tuna\
I need to have a list of bookmarks with the tuna websites

As a user\
So i can choose a bookmark\
I'd like to see a list of all stored bookmarks

As santa\
So i know where the good developers live\
I'd need to be able to add their address to the list of bookmarks
